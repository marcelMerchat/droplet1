# crudBasic

The Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) website provides a way to enter resumes of job candidates into a database. It was developed from the Capstone project for the University of Michigan web-development course on Coursera. However, to avoid publishing a copy of the Capstone assignment as well as improve it, this version of a CRUD website was developed. Users enter resume data for as many job candidates as desired in the website database and to subsequently view the resumes on another screen. Here is a summary of the improvements.

At the welcome page, the user sees a summary list of job candidates entered by users or managers. Resumes can be viewed without logging-in by clicking a link on the welcome page, but after logging-in, users only see their own resumes and they are provided links for adding new resumes, editing an existing one, or deleting it. There is a guest login where visitors can enter and edit resumes as well as view resumes made by guests using the login name 'guest@mycompany.com' with password 'login123'. Visitors can obtain their own password and receive a confirming e-mail automatically to the email they submit for their account. If visitors forget their password they can recover their account if they remember the hint. Here is a summary of the changes.

More like a Resume than a Profile:

In the original project, the resume was a view of profile information. Here it is expanded to be a person's resume. There is a new entry for the person's occupation and the headline box is now called 'Goals.' There is a new list of job skills that is similar to the education list with an associated database table for skills that mirrors the table of educational institutions. Users are provided with existing skills by means of JSON enquiries to the website. A major subject box was added to education. The work experience has been expanded into separate company and summary blocks.

A further enhancement was the use of JavaScript to change the layout for mobile devices by making DOM elements directly.

Offensive Language Blocking:

A website needs to protect children and adults from unnecessary harassing language and provide pages suitable for a general audience. To help implement this, entered data is screened for offensive language, increasing the data verification performed with JavaScript for the browser as well as final checking at the website using PHP. There are two new database tables at the website named Dictionary and Offensive. Extending my SQL course work, a programmed loop loaded the 11,000 word dictionary into the database from a delimited text file of words.

The language filter algorithm starts by removing punctuation and exploding the text phrase into an array of words which are automatically accepted if they are in the dictionary table. If the words are not in the dictionary, the data is still entered into the database after further filtering for offensive words using the Offensive table. This method helps eliminate unnecessary rejections of legitimate words. The offensive word list only exists in unreadable coded form in the database at the website. The dictionary was constructed for my Capstone Project based on Twitter chat data for the Data Science Certificate by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The GitHub offensive word list of about 100 words was taken from the same project.

A further enhancement was the use of JavaScript to change the layout for mobile devices. DOM elements were directly constructed with JavaScript which is an alternate way of page modification in addition to the hot element insertion blocks and the jQuery append methods. Since an if statement could also have been used with the append method, it's not clear how much direct construction of DOM elements helped and it used a number of lines of code that are fairly complex; I still used it to place the start and final year entry boxes on the same line for wide screens. This is mainly kept as a template of reusable code for a future website.

The email is handled by means of the 'PHPMailer' package installed using the Compose Package. These are available without cost. The code also works in the test environment on localhost. The site was developed using the Apache2 server on localhost in the Microsoft Ubuntu extension for Windows 10 and the online site runs on nginx server in an Ubuntu cloud droplet.

Notes about the Website:

The online site is a functional computer which exists as a block called a droplet within a larger server or a Cloud of servers. The droplet is an Ubuntu Linux system. The PHP web files were tested using an Apache2 server on localhost in the Microsoft Ubuntu extension for Windows 10. The website droplet had been previously setup with nginx server following a data scientist on another project in order to host webpages generated using RStudio. But I had just completed the University of Michigan Web-Development program and felt it was a better idea to install the CRUD Capstone Project on the droplet. Since my website works with both servers and installing the server in the Ubuntu linux environment in the droplet was not trivial, it's best to leave it as a future project to replace nginx with Apache in the cloud droplet in order to provide a more uniform testing environment. I took careful notes for the server installations, but changing the server probably will require some further debugging.

The cost for the server droplet computer of $5 per month is economical, but the server and database are installed from scratch in the Linux environment compared to website running in an assigned folder on a shared computer.

Linux Commands:

The C: drive for windows exists at '/mnt/c' in the linux environment.

Since it easier to work with the text files in the Window enviroment, copy the folder from the Windows side to the Ubuntu server folder for testing on localhost:

sudo cp /mnt/c/Users/merch/Documents/edu/web_developer/mmdotcom/crudbasic/* /var/www/html/crudBasic

Copy droplet repo to crudBasic folder
sudo cp /home/gramps/repos/crudBasic/* /var/www/marcel-merchat.com/html/crudBasic

At this time, the Ubuntu linux side of Windows 10, is only a command-line environment. This is the main reason for working on the Windows side and copying the folder to the Ubuntu server folder.
